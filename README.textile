h1. Minimax Demonstrated Using Tic-Tac-Toe in Ruby, Lisp and Haskell

h2. Ruby

To run the ruby version, make sure tictactoe.rb has execute privileges and run @./tictactoe.rb@.

h2. Common Lisp

For the lisp version, you need install a Lisp implementation. I use clisp. On a mac, you can install that with "brew install clisp".

After that, @cd@ to the "phase1" directory and run @clisp@ in your shell. When clisp loads, run @(load 'tictactoe)@

Enter @(exit)@ to end the session.

h2. Clojure

Enter the fms.tictactoe namespace and run @(start)@

h2. Haskell

Compile with @ghc —-make tictactoe.hs@ and run @./tictactoe@ or load it into ghci with @:l tictactoe.hs@ and run @main@.
